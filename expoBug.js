This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android SDK or build tools.  The exact error message might vary, but it usually points to problems in the Android environment setup or configuration. One common cause is incompatibility between the versions of the Android SDK, build tools, and the Expo CLI itself. Another potential cause is a problem with the Android emulator or device you are trying to target.  Insufficient storage space on the build machine could also lead to this failure.
