To solve this, ensure that the Android SDK, build tools, and Android SDK command-line tools are installed and configured correctly. Verify compatibility between their versions and the Expo CLI version.  Use the Android SDK Manager to install or update necessary components.  Check your environment variables, particularly `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, to make sure they point to the correct Android SDK location. If using an emulator, confirm it's properly configured and running.  Also, ensure sufficient disk space is available for the build process.  Cleaning the project (using `expo prebuild --clean`) and then rebuilding can also help resolve some of these issues.  If these steps don't resolve the issue, providing the complete error message will help in diagnosing the problem more accurately.
